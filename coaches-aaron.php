                        <p>Aaron Garza graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2011 with a Bachelors Degree in Civil Engineering. But don't let the nerd in him fool you. He has been involved in sports since the age of 4. Basketball, football, and track have set the foundation for his athletic background. He began competing in the endurance space throughout college which ultimately led to the completion of the 2012 Dallas White Rock Marathon. In June of 2013, while training for the Austin 70.3 IRONMAN, a cycling accident landed him in the ER with a broken tibia. It was during the injury rehabilitation process that he discovered CrossFit.</p>
                        <p style="margin: 8px 10px;font-style: italic;">&quot;It was a tough time for me. I went from working out 6 days a week to non-weight bearing for 9 weeks. During my rehab, CrossFit provided me the opportunity to address my limited range of motion and mobility with healthy, strength specific training. I instantly fell in love with CrossFit and always knew that one day I'd give back and serve the same community that did so much for me.&quot;</p>
                        <p>After immersing himself in the world of CrossFit for nearly 3 years, he earned his Level 1 Trainer Certification. With his engineering background, Aaron has a deep passion for problem solving, especially when it comes to human movement. </p>
                        <p>Whether your goal is to reach a deeper squat, learn to better cycle a barbell, get your first pull-up, or just get started, Aaron can help!</p>
