                        <p>Hart is a life-long athlete and adoring father who enjoys CrossFit, yoga, hiking the greenbelt, and comedy. He joined BPC in 2013 and immediately loved the community of athlete mentors and the constant challenge provided by CrossFit.</p>
                        <p>"Joining BPC had a transformative effect on my life and my health,” Hart said. “I can't wait to continue sharing that with others, especially now in my role as the owner. I've had a lifetime of athletics, and yet Brodie Park CrossFit has a true focus on creating a supportive environment different from any other fitness experience."</p>
                        <p>Hart said he is thrilled to become the owner of the gym and has plans on how to continue building the existing community-centered fitness and athletics programs. Brodie Park CrossFit offers group CrossFit classes for both adults and kids, personal training, endurance training, Olympic lifting, bootcamps, and a free Community Workout every Saturday. Supporting all levels of athlete, programs are equally geared for those who are just starting their fitness journey to competitive athletes. At the same time, Hart said he and his coaching team plan to keep the spirit of the gym alive and well by continuing to create a supportive and fun environment.</p>
                        <p>“A good physical condition allows us to enjoy our lives, our families, and our communities, and we want to help South Austin enjoy this same quality of life,” Hart said.</p>
                        <p>Hart said the free Community Workout on Saturday mornings at 9 a.m. is an additional way the gym keeps its community relationship alive while also providing a way to make fitness achievable for all walks of life. Whether it’s for someone who has always been curious about CrossFit or for those who are looking to check out other Crossfit gyms in town, Brodie Park Crossfit is a great a place for every Austinite. The gym is also available for personal trainers seeking a clean and comfortable space to train their clients as well as host community events.</p>
                        <p>"Seeing my little one excited to go to the gym with me tells me we're building a foundation for enjoying fitness that she will carry with her throughout her lifetime. Not to mention the pride in her eyes when someone she saw lifting hundreds of pounds can't believe how good her pull-up form is," Hart said. “I've seen the transformative effect that Brodie Park CrossFit had on my life, and I can't wait to share that with others.”</p>
