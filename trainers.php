						<p>Erin's CrossFit training began in 2010.  Her passion for CrossFit came about when she became a member of BPC.  "CrossFit works for me because I love to compete to get better results.  I get to challenge myself with something new everyday and I love that!  I come from an extremely competitive background where my whole family is very athletic.  I played tennis at a high level for the last 14 years so the CrossFit environment is right up my alley."  Since March of 2012, Erin has loved every minute of her training at BPC.  This love has led her to get certified in CrossFit and CrossFit Kids.  Erin now teaches the teens class at BPC and has even incorporated some CrossFit moves into her PE classes at school.</p>
