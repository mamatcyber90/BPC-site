                        <p>After spending several years in The Marine Corps, JC realized fitness would always be a large part of what defined him as a person and would be essential to his overall wellbeing and safety during his career as a Police Officer. He was introduced to CrossFit by a friend and co-worker back in 2009 while working as a PT (Physical Training) Instructor at the Austin Police Academy, and he has been hooked ever since! He has been involved in many forms of sports such as soccer, football, triathlons, long distance running, weight training, mountain biking and motocross throughout the entirety of his life, so CrossFit was a natural fit. JCâ€™s passion for CrossFit and healthy living carries over to his strong desire to help others meet their fitness and wellness goals and succeed in life. He enjoys the camaraderie and positive atmosphere of the CrossFit community and appreciates the overwhelming feeling of accomplishment and success shared by all. Semper Fi, JC</p>
