                        <p>Shelley holds a Bachelor of Science degree from Angelo State University. Shelley is a United States Probation Officer and has been in the field for over 15 years. She has served as a divisional Defensive Tactics Instructor, and continues to train in defensive tactics and firearms. Her introduction to CrossFit came in 2011 while living in Midland and Del Rio and she has been hooked ever since. Shelly is also active in CrossFit competitions, adventure races, and charity events because she enjoys the challenge that comes with setting a goal, working toward it, and achieving her personal best. As a coach, she strives to help her athletes do the same.</p>
                        <p>Whether a beginner or advanced athlete, she believes that CrossFit can help anyone reach their peak performance. She’s personally seen the impact that training in the box can have on someone’s well-being – having gone through the intense injuries of a motorcycle accident herself. She has seen first hand how training with CrossFit prepares someone for the mental and physical stamina it takes to endure intense physical therapy and make a full recovery.</p>
                        <p>Shelly views CrossFit as a lifestyle change and an opportunity to challenge yourself in a way that isn’t possible with any other type of “regular” gyms.</p>
