                        <p>Coach David is a native Austinite and loves his city. He first entered the world of CrossFit back in the summer of 2008. Having trained in Krav Maga for several years prior and being a self-proclaimed Globo Gym Rat, he considered himself as someone who was in pretty good shape.  He quickly learned however, as most people do after their first few bouts with a CrossFit WOD, just how out of shape and how weak he really was in many areas.</p>
                        <p>You could say this was a "life changing" moment for him as he would quit his nice, coosh, high paying job in the IT Support Field a couple of years later to pursue his passion of helping others through health and fitness.  He received his Level 1 Certification in 2011 and worked under the guidance of many great teachers, coaches, chiropractors, physical therapists gaining invaluable knowledge on human movement and biomechanics as well as exposure to many different training methodologies outside of the CrossFit world.</p>
                        <p>David is also an avid OCR (Obstacle Course Racer) and has completed countless Spartan Races, BattleFrogs, Tough Mudders, and just about every other race that comes to town. He travels to Phoenix every February to "kick-off" his race season at The AZ Spartan Sprint. He has competed in a number of local 5 and 10ks and just this past year, took 1st place overall at the Lakeside 5K in Jonestown!</p>
                        <p>David as described by some of his clients:</p>
                        <p style="margin: 8px 10px;font-style: italic;">&quot;Caring and committed to his own fitness and to the encouragement of others towards their own life and fitness  goals. He pursues fitness knowledge and experience with avidity.  A person who listens to what trainees desire to achieve, while understanding their limitations whether perceived or truly physical and encourages achievement by example, motivation and real life experiences.&quot;</p>
                        <p style="margin: 8px 10px;font-style: italic;">&quot;Meets each person where they are in order to build a base upon which to achieve greater things.&quot;</p>
                        <p style="margin: 8px 10px;font-style: italic;">&quot;Truly cares about each person's success and helps examine their failures to improve their performance.&quot;</p>
                        <p style="margin: 8px 10px;font-style: italic;">&quot;Has the ability to work around an athletes injuries or preferences and although he typically teaches in a group setting, you feel like you are receiving individual attention and he  goes out of his way to make sure you reach your fitness goals.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Outside of the gym, you can find David (if he's not on an OCR Course) running around with his puppy Haus or kicking back on the Greenbelt or at the lake during the hot summer months. He fancies a shot or few of Jamesons (in moderation); it's the Irish in him and just enjoys a good time with good friends and family!</p>
